# Todo

This is a doc just to list out what I want to achieve with this fork, or at least my ideas, just so I can write them down and not forget them.

 - [ ] Cleaner UI
   - [x] Remove header, banner, footer
   - [ ] Make it configurable
 - [ ] Easier way to implement opening images and links in general.
   - Currently it's a little bit clunky in the sense that you'll have to setup mailcap, instead I'd prefer if it was just configured in the `rtv.cfg`
 - [ ] A bit more customization
   - As an example customizing certain strings that are currently hard coded (Most of this would be strings in `rtv/docs.py`) this could open up for some localization if I want.
   - I haven't quite looked into how rtv actually works, what libraries it uses and so on, so I can't quite say what else I'd like to add.
 - [ ] Possible ease of use additions
   - Adding shortcuts to certain things that aren't currently able to get a shortcut and so on... Or adding some more command line options for automation or similar.
 - *More may be added later...*
